When I was young I created ficiontal characters, explored fantastical worlds and played made up games. Most people grow out of their inner child, but I still have the same wide-eyed view to this day. I guess that makes me different than most people. I've been studying Computer Science and Studio Art in the Chicagoland area, and I am currently working on several large scale video game based projects.</div>

Although digital is my preferred medium, I like to make my art look more traditional. I would say my paintings mostly follow an impressionistic style with clear distinct brush strokes and a mix of blended an unblended colors.</div>
